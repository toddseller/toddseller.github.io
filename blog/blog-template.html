          Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.
        </p>

          You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.
