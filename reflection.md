####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
When I was first learning CSS I would often get confused by how elements were affected by padding and margins. As I have become more comfortable with CSS I realize that margins affect the spacing from one element to another and that padding affects the spacing within the element itself.

####What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Using a grid system is so much easier than trying to do it own your own.

####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
My design was pretty straight forward and I didn't find anything all that difficult to implement.

####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
That it is easier to add your classes after your HTML skeleton is complete. I tend to stylize as I write my HTML and that sometimes adds to repeated styles.
